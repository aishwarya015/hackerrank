###Two Strings a and b are of different lengths are given.
Find the minimum number of characters which must be removed to make it an anagrams to each other.

t=int(input())
while(t!=0):
    s=list(input())
    p=list(input())
    c=0
    ls=len(s)
    lp=len(p)
    for i in s:
        for j in p:
            if(i==j):
                c=c+1
                
    a=ls+lp-(c*2)
    print(a)
    t=t-1
 
##Sample Input 0
1
dct
tfd
Sample Output 0

2
Explanation 0

To make it anagrams to each other: Delete c from dct. Delete f from tfd. print the count of deletion character.


##Velski buys an array A of N integer values.In 1 second he can increase value of 
each array element by 1.He wants each array element's value to become greater than or equal to K.
Please help velski to find out the minimum time it will take,for him to do so.

t=int(input())
while(t!=0):
    n,k=map(int,input().split())
    a=list(map(int,input().split()))
    c=[]
    count=0
    for i in range(0,len(a)):
        while(a[i]<k):
            a[i]=a[i]+1
            count=count+1
        c.append(count)
        count=0
    print(max(c))
    t=t-1

For 1st testcase, In 1 second,array A={2,3,6} In 2 second,array A={3,4,7} In 3 second,array A={4,5,8}
So,it will take 3 second for all array element to become greater than or equal to K
